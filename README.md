# 100 Days of coding challenge with c++
Hi there! Have you ever heard about 100 days of coding challenge? If you have not, I **strongly recommend** you to take a look on this website [100daysofcode.com](100daysofcode.com).

It is a challenge to change one's life, not completely changing that but to help him/her achieve something desired or long awaited for.

I have started the challenge a couple of days ago. My challenge is about c++ programming language. Every single day I do code to solve a new problem using c++ language. I have decided to embedd a test function for every program I write. Anyway some of them I feel do not need a test function because they are straight forward.
The following table will get updated every day I do something new. 

If you want to warm up, jump in! Do my challenge.

Today, 18-7-2023 I completed Math challenges, and I am going to solve challenges from the second chapter. The subject of this chapter is language features. I am really longing to start this chapter.

Tonight I think chapter two was also finished. I happy to see I have completed nearly 22 challenges. The date of today is 12-8-2023.
It is nearly a month past the day I finished chapter one. This chapter was more challenging than the first chapter. I learned and yet many more things are left. I have not a clear vision about constexpr, about inline specifier, etc.
In this chapter I left p21 unsolved, intentionaly. Because it has a flavour of windows c++ which I am not really into. Preferrably I code in linux not beyond it.
Now it is time to go for more challenges!

Today is 15-09-2023. So the last chapter took nearly a month. Tomorrow morning I am going to Istanbul. A couple of weeks ago I was on another trip to another country.That is why my contributions figure has more blank squares than the months before. Anyway, chapter 3 is now done. I am going for another adventure in chapter 4 which is about "Streams and Filesystems".

Well, the last chapter was finished on 14-10-2023, it means this chapter took a month to complete. I was in Istanbul so I did not code a week. Therefore I think I have become better at coding. This month I started to add some more problems from another book that I think really helped me to grasp the concepts of filesystem lib. Now I am going for another chapter of challenge. Ladies and Gentlemen, Here is DATE and TIME!

Today is 23-01-2024, I just finished Date and Time excercises. It has taken a long time since my last writing here. That is because during this period of time I started reading the book C++17 STL cookbook. I got through all the excercises, it was about 500 pages from containers to iterators all the way down to conc.urrency and filesystem. I started to read also another book named "c++ standard library, A tutorial and reference". I have dived deep in the C++ books, honestly I can say that I have just grasped a big picture! Yet many more left to learn. Yet need to make my hands dirty. The next chapter is about algorithms and datastructures. For solving any data structure (here priority_queue, set, map, red black tree, trie, tree binary search tree) I am going through other different books and courses to learn about them. So I might not be able to meet my time goals.

Today I finished algorithms chapter. In the meanwhile I tried to learn cmake and I got through it deeply to some extent. I am ready now to go for the next chapter. I will try to learn as much as I can, and I am eager to reach cryptography chapter soon in the future. The next chapter is about concurrency, I hope it will not be too difficult. No worries, let's go.

Day by day I am getting better at c++ and recently at cmake! On the other hand I am very interested in cryptography, so I jumped to problem 91 and solved user credential challenge. Little by little I will solve other challenges of this chapter also, and even may before finishing concurrency challenges.
