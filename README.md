# 100 Days of coding challenge with c++
Hi there! Have you ever heard about 100 days of coding challenge? If you have not, I **strongly recommend** you to take a look on this website [100daysofcode.com](100daysofcode.com).

It is a challenge to change one's life, not completely changing that but to help him/her achieve something desired or long awaited for.

I have started the challenge a couple of days ago. My challenge is about c++ programming language. Every single day I do code to solve a new problem using c++ language. I have decided to embedd a test function for every program I write. Anyway some of them I feel do not need a test function because they are straight forward.
The following table will get updated every day I do something new. 

If you want to warm up, jump in! Do my challenge.

Today, 18-7-2023 I completed Math challenges, and I am going to solve challenges from the second chapter. The subject of this chapter is language features. I am really longing to start this chapter.
